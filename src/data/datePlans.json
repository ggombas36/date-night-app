Then came the classy post-dinner stroll down Andrássy út, pretending we were in a rom-com montage — just with more tzatziki breath. 🥙💙",

      "description": "This week’s adventure: A flavorful journey through the streets and spices of the city! We kicked things off with a fiery dinner at Indigo Express near Nyugati — where every bite felt like a passport stamp to India. 🌶️🕌 Then came dessert at the fancy McDonald's (yes, the chandelier one 💁), because opposites attract. Full of curry and McFlurry, we strolled to the other Indigo Express by Deák — not for seconds, but for the vibes. Finished the night strong with a dreamy cheesecake moment, then a slow romantic walk home along Andrássy út, soaking in the city lights and our shared food coma. 🧀❤️✨",
