    "description": "This Sunday, it’s all about sweet spontaneity — with sunshine we’ll chase strawberries, and with raindrops we’ll dive into diamonds. 🍓🌧️💍 Plan A? A charming countryside escape to pick ripe strawberries straight from the vine — red fingertips, laughter in the rows, and baskets brimming with summer. But if the skies turn gray, fear not! We’ll head instead to the Hungarian National Museum to finally catch the 'Shine! – The Time of Jewels' exhibition and bask in stories told through gold, gems, and time itself. Whichever path we take, the evening ends with golden crispiness: dinner at a cozy Pesti Pipi spot of our choosing. Because whether it’s berries or brilliance — we always make it sparkle. ✨",

    "description": "This Friday’s plan is all about sparkle, history, and a touch of elegance. ✨ We’ll meet at 5 PM at Vörösmarty Square, then head home to get ready for an evening full of fascination. The main event? A visit to the ‘Shine! – The Time of Jewels’ exhibition at the Hungarian National Museum. Set in a beautiful historic setting, this special showcase spans 40,000 years of jewelry — from ancient gold treasures and medieval gems to 19th-century reimagined masterpieces and even hauntingly personal pieces made from horseshoe nails and human hair. More than just decoration, each piece tells a story of identity, memory, and meaning. It's a glittering journey through time and style — and the perfect excuse to get a little dressed up. 💫👗 After the exhibition, dinner is on the agenda — and Kicsi gets to choose the place this time! 🍽️💖",

Then it’s on to Primark, where the deals are hot and the style is even hotter. After that, we’ll swing by Praktiker next to Lurdy Ház for a practical pause, and end the spree strolling through Lurdy for any last finds. It’s shopping, bonding, and budget-blowing all in one. 🛒💸",

Full of curry and McFlurry, we strolled to the other Indigo Express by Deák — not for seconds, but for the vibes. Finished the night strong with a dreamy cheesecake moment, then a slow romantic walk home along Andrássy út, soaking in the city lights and our shared food coma. 🧀❤️✨",
