    "date": "2025.04.11",
    "description": "This Friday’s date night is less about fine dining and more about shopping galore — just the way Kicsi likes it! ✨ Starting off at Vörösmarty Square, we'll head home to grab our bags and prep for a serious shopping mission. First stop: Arena Mall and Primark — where the deals are hot and the style is even hotter. Then we’ll swing by Praktiker next to Lurdy Ház for a practical pause, and end the spree strolling through Lurdy for any last finds. It’s shopping, bonding, and budget-blowing all in one. 🛒💸",

    "description": "This week’s adventure: A flavorful journey through the streets and spices of the city! We kicked things off with a fiery dinner at Indigo Express near Nyugati — where every bite felt like a passport stamp to India. 🌶️🕌 Then came dessert at the fancy McDonald's (yes, the chandelier one 💁), because opposites attract. Full of curry and McFlurry, we strolled to the other Indigo Express by Deák — not for seconds, but for the vibes. Finished the night strong with a dreamy cheesecake moment, then a slow romantic walk home along Andrássy út, soaking in the city lights and our shared food coma. 🧀❤️✨",
